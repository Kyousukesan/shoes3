This is Shoes 3.3 (Walkabout). Download binaries for your platfrom from
<http://shoesrb.com>

Earlier releases of Shoes were Raisins, Policeman and Federales (2.0, 3.1 and 3.2)
There is a Shoes 4 under development. For historical reasons (the 
color of the icon in Raisins), it's also called Red Shoes. Red Shoes is written
in C (and some Objective C on the Mac). Shoes 4 is written in Java. 

[Federales](https://github.com/Shoes/shoes3/blob/master/README.federales)
was a maintenance release to keep Red Shoes current with modern 
Linux, OSX, and Windows distributions and newer versions of Ruby and ruby gems.
Federales didn't really add any new features to Shoes except that it works now.
The packaging ability is working again!

Walkabout (Shoes 3.3) does add new features to Shoes Features that may not be
compatible with Shoes 4. 

* new options for packaging. 
* Uses a more modern Ruby (2.2.+) and Ruby Gems (2.4.+)
* Shoes can display SVG files and sub-sections (group name) of them.
* Video widgets work again. Dependent on all kinds of thing Shoes can't
  control.
  
The latest stable version is 3.3.6; you can read about it [here](https://walkabout.mvmanila.com/2018/03/03/shoes-3-3-6), and download it from [here](https://walkabout.mvmanila.com/public/shoes).
