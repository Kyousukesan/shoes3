= Walkabout - Shoes 3.3
  The name reflects back to when Shoes creator why_the_lucky_stiff disappeared
  from the internet. He went walkabout! We changed some icons and backgrounds
  to relect that whimsical theme.  
  
  Walkabout (3.3+) will be less compatible with the unmaintained 3.1 and with 4.0 (jRuby)
  We have interesting ideas of we what we do with Shoes that may be difficult
  to immplememt in Shoes 4.

  * New platform - freebsd 11.1 (64). Can build, run, install and package for.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/365
  * Dead platform - 32 bit i686 (Linux intel) target is no longer supported
  * libcurl.dll/dylib/so and new gems are included with Shoes. require 'typhoeus'
    to use it. When net/http and open_uri is too confusing, arcane and limiting. 
    On Windows it's not faster (or slower) - just better in other ways. 
    see https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus
  * Method app.resize can programaticly expand the window.
    see https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/370

    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/362
  * new freebsd target (loose and tight shoes)

  * new samples added 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/317

    prebuilt dependcies for msys2 has newer Gtk 3.14.15 
    NOT ready for prime time. 
  * Shoes manual has a new text search engine - 'picky' which added these gems into
    shoes:

    Newer sqlite3 & chipmunk gems are included as real gems.
  ** Major restucturing of C source code. 
    Less monolithic, more files but smaller files.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/333
  * rake files cleaned up and much faster if you are developing at the C level.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/334

    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/251
  * samples and files are renamed to better fit a 'cleanup'

=== Fixed with 3.3.3
  * OSX retina display should work. Finder->Show Info displays accurate info
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/310
  * Restored Windows Theme (for Windows) - slows initialization slightly. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/345

    issues: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/2
            https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/38
            https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/355
    new feaure.
  * moved samples/classbook.* to samples/good/_why-stories.*
  * Manual disply of samples (Furthermore->Sample) now
    explicitly ordered from simple to good to expert.
  * fix samples/simple/sqlites3.rb to work better on windows
    and use UTF-8

-------------- Shoes 3.3.2 ----------------------------------

=== New with 3.3.2
  * Ruby is updated to 2.2.6 (windows still uses 2.2.4)
  * gems is updated to 2.6.8
  * Profiler with both a GUI and the more traditional text report.
    Written in Shoes and Ruby so you can modify it if you like. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/232
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Profiling
    
  * Shoes.show_console is now Shoes.terminal with many options for size, and
    colors. It can handle some common escape sequences (colors and bolding)  
    On Windows:
      Use Msys>  cshoes.exe
      or install one of those ANSI dll things for your DOS era console. 
      Rumor: Win 10 does support ansi escape sequences on it's console.
      Sometimes Win7 does ok with some escape sequence. 
    On OSX - scrollbars might not show up. page up/down keys and home/end
      and scroll wheel do work.
    Useful for running unit tests of Shoes and other terminal stuff like the
    profiler text report.
    Note: raspbian may have font issues for 'monospace' font.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/236
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/256
    
  * exit should no long be used. Please use Shoes.quit
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/263
  
  * plot widget (line,bar,scatter, pie charts and radar/spider) 
      https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/288
      https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/264
      https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Plot-Widget
      expect some confusion and bugs.
      
  * rename method 'refresh_slot' to 'refresh' before too many people 
    use the old name.  This could break some scripts.

=== Fixed with 3.3.2
  * Radio buttons fix
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/274
  * A new launch script for OSX (cshoes) that works like Linux and Windows
    from the command line. Use Cobbler to create your osx cshoes script.
  * Windows: bug261 - fix font loading
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/261
  * debugging with byebug is much better.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/263
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Debugging-with-Byebug
  * fixed: click and release methods return the documented button. top, left 
    values. Button numbers start with left button = 1 and increases from there. 
    How many buttons and how they are numbered is not something Shoes can know 
    about so it's the user repsonsibility to be cross platform with buttons > 1.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/240

=== Developer isssues for 3.3.2
  * no improvements per se although I consider the byebug and osx cshoes major
    improvements for Shoes internals developers
----------------------------------------------------------
  
=== New with 3.3.1
  * Video widget. If you have VLC installed, Shoes will find it (and
    you can tell Shoes where your VLC is). Once found, you can use it. 
    You can not package VLC with you script however. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/133
    Caution: may not work on OSX < 10.10
  * Secondary packaging. Use a Shoes installer script to install your app. Not 
    for the casual. Pretty damn clever and confusing so there's likely to
    be bugs and confusion.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Custom-Install-Scripts
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Command-line-package
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/188
  * Uses Ruby 2.2.4. If you have native Gems that were built by earlier
    versions, they may not work. - Uninstall and reinstall the gem. 
  * Windows: Shoes comes with win32-shortcut gem. Undocumented and the
    online docs you do find are not always up to date.  
  
=== Fixed with 3.3.1
  * start {} blocks on stacks and flows work much better. 
  * Windows: does not use FONTCONFIG_FILE env var. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/216
    Benefits: Faster install, multiple installs, enables merge packaging
       https://github.com/Shoes3/exe-shoes
  * Linux: fixed edit_box bug with Gtk >= 3.16
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/217
  * OSX: don't duplicate Shoes.app windows. Nasty if it happens to you. 
    Cshoes suffered from this bug too. That works better now for OSX.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/190
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/175
  * Windows: ask_color crashes. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/209
  * updated wiki article on building shoes with Linux.
  * remote debugger issue with newer byebug
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/231
    
=== Developer issues for 3.3.1
  * deleted gtk2 code. Video code is included.
    Some rakefiles were modified and are slightly less confusing.
  * Windows: dependencies have changed - using  Gtk 3.10.9 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Mingw-Dependencies
    Download from http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoesdeps/mingw/ming-Shoes-3.3.1.tar.gz
    if you need them - it's a huge file!

--------------------------------------------------------

=== new with 3.3.0
  * Uses Gtk3 (not gtk2) for Linux and Windows. This will change visuals
    on both platorms. 
  * add font and wrap styles for list_box. A popular request - we are
    limited to what Gtk3 can do, however. 
    The default behaviour for long strings in the list box is now to 
    ellispise ... in the middle. THIS could effect your current apps.
    Issue 109 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/109
  * A new Svg widget to display svg images - similar to Image but 
    NOT the same. Has aspect scaling options based on the svg internals.
    See samples/good-svgview.rb. samples/good-flip.rb and the manual. 
    We also include a svg deck of playing cards. 
    It's a  bit fragile  so please file bug reports and feature requests. 
    Very verbose Issue 54 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/54
    Pay attention to the OSX workaround #178 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/178
    Preliminary save and export methods:

  * add a refresh slot method
    Issue 152 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/152
  * Uses ruby 2.1.7 and rubygems 2.4.7
    Issue 164 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/164
  * New splash screen (no animation).
  * added samples/good-image-rotate.rb because it's fun to watch.
    Issue 157 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/157

=== Fixed with 3.3.0
  * OSX - do not use home brew to manage dependecies. 
    wiki: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/OSX-10.9-Dependencies15
    wiki: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/OSX-10.6-Dependencies
  * Remove pango-querymodules from OSX. Yay!

  * repaint after slot remove
    Issue 151 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/151
  * Windows: 256x256 icons failed when packaging.
    Issue 10 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/10
  * developer name and RVM and linker info gets embedded in 
    binary libraries. No solution worth persueing. 
    Issue 66 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/66
  * Windows: fontconfig problems if you build shoes and download shoes
    Issue 141 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/141

=== New with 3.2.24
   * added show_console command for OSX and Linux to match Windows. 
     Dumber that dumb console. Works with readline if you don't expect too
     much. Although -w and --console switches do work on the command line 
     you probably don't need them now that you can call Shoes::show_console
     Wiki: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Design:-New-Shoes-Console

     writes them to a file (pdf, svg or ps)
     Search the manual for 'snapshot'.

  * Added (minimal) documentation for fullscreen, set_window_title, 
    set_window_icon_path for special situations.
  * Enabled Gtk2 theme engine on Windows. Better looking UI. Can be 
    changed by a knowledable user. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/24
  * The Ruby included with Shoes doesn't have ancient gdbm compatabibility 
    It's a feature you probably don't care about. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/84
  * alert, ask, confirm dialogs can change the "Shoes says" and "Shoes asks"
